# Introduction
UI Kit is a lightweight collection of essential UI components written in Vue, meant to compliment and replace the default Bootstrap 4 jQuery-based JavaScript file.

UI Kit is **not** a CSS framework. While you will find a basic grid component - it is not meant for common web design purposes. You won't find styles for button, typography, links, tables, or any other form of web element. Instead, the focus is on creating reusable components that have interactivity utilizing the Bootstrap 4 framework.

## Installation
UI Kit is distributed through npm as a registered private package. You must first be given read-access to the repository to be able to download the package through npm. Be sure you've logged in under your account through `npm`.

```
npm i @efelle/ui-kit --save
```
