# Introduction
UI Kit is a lightweight collection of essential UI components written in Vue, meant to compliment and replace the default Bootstrap 4 jQuery-based JavaScript file.

UI Kit is **not** a CSS framework. While you will find a basic grid component - it is not meant for common web design purposes. You won't find styles for button, typography, links, tables, or any other form of web element. Instead, the focus is on creating reusable components that have interactivity utilizing the Bootstrap 4 framework.
